Dataparency's Distributed Data Network / Information Sharing Platform&trade; is an Entity-centric, Entity-bound, and Entity-controlled NoSQL distributed database providing access control, security, and a 'schema-agnostic' data model. 

It is highly scalable as data can be sharded by entity. Combined with FaaS, such as AWS Lambda, it can support thousands to millions of accesses per second. 
It is appropriate for use cases where privacy and security are essential for compliance with standards such as GDPR and CCPA.
Please refer to the whitepaper for further details.
